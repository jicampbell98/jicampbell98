## Introduction

I'm training to become a data scientist, and I like problem solving and working with data.

## Objective

My journey in economics and programming has led me to develop an interest for data analysis and machine learning. Despite the lack of formal data science programs in my country, I hope to learn by myself through textbooks and projects, to develop a good foundation that allows me to study and understand machine learning in the near future.
